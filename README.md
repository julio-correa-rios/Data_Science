# Data_Science

In the following link you can find a talk I gave in April 2021, about Data Science. You will find my approach to the field and the main elements to consider when it comes to start a project. 

Here, the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jWjoRg43Dk&t=2254s&ab_channel=Indexar) to it (in Spanish.)

In the folders, I will upload some projects where I have been involved in the last months. They are about applying and coding different classification algorithms to real-world datasets.
